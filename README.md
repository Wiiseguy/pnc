# PNC
> **P**oint '**N** **C**lick


## History
This is the third port of the original PNC, which was written in C++ and OpenGL, back in 2010. The second port was created in 2015, in JavaScript and HTML and even included and editor. Both of them parsed a custom language, but this eventually led to being the most complex part of both those versions.

The goal of this iteration is to make the syntax as close to the original as possible, but make it in pure JavaScript.


### Getting started
`npm run run-dev`
or run `run-dev` from Task Explorer > pnc > npm.
